✅ COMPLETED: NetGuard - Network Traffic Monitor & Gambling Blocker

## What's Been Implemented:

### Core Features ✅
- ✅ Flask web application with modern UI
- ✅ Real-time network traffic monitoring using psutil
- ✅ Machine learning gambling detection using scikit-learn (Naive Bayes + TF-IDF)
- ✅ Automatic website blocking via hosts file modification
- ✅ SQLite database with comprehensive schema
- ✅ Separate database manager (database_manager.py)
- ✅ Real-time traffic monitor (traffic_monitor.py)

### Web Interface ✅
- ✅ index.html - Dashboard with real-time stats and recent detections
- ✅ details.html - Detailed detection logs with search and filtering
- ✅ settings.html - Configuration panel with sensitivity, language, theme
- ✅ dev_traffic.html - Developer mode for detailed traffic analysis
- ✅ All pages connected with navigation and animations
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Machine Learning ✅
- ✅ Sklearn-based classification (Naive Bayes)
- ✅ Processes URLs, headers, request/response content
- ✅ Multi-language gambling keyword detection (English, Indonesian)
- ✅ Configurable sensitivity settings
- ✅ Auto-learning capabilities

### Developer Mode ✅
- ✅ Detailed HTTP/HTTPS traffic logging
- ✅ mitmproxy integration for deep packet inspection
- ✅ View all network traffic (not just flagged content)
- ✅ Request/response headers and body analysis
- ✅ Traffic export functionality
- ✅ Real-time traffic monitoring dashboard

### Database ✅
- ✅ SQLite database with multiple tables:
  - detection_logs: ML detection results
  - traffic_logs: Detailed HTTP traffic (dev mode)
  - settings: Application configuration
  - blocked_sites: Blocked website list
  - network_connections: Real-time connections
- ✅ Comprehensive database manager with threading support
- ✅ Data cleanup and maintenance functions

### Additional Features ✅
- ✅ Real-time statistics and monitoring
- ✅ Automatic and manual website blocking/unblocking
- ✅ Export/import functionality
- ✅ Multi-language support
- ✅ Theme customization
- ✅ Setup script for easy installation
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## How to Use:

1. **Setup**: Run `python setup.py` (requires admin privileges)
